Objective: Create an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds and tests code committed to GitHub, with build status notifications sent to a WebEx space.

Total points: 40

Requirements

1. A GitHub repository
2. Jenkins running in a Docker container
3. ngrok for exposing local Jenkins instance to the internet
4. A WebEx bot for receiving notifications

Tasks

1. Set up a GitHub repository with simple Python code. It should have unit tests for the Python code. You will commit the code to your repo from your local machine.
2. Configure a webhook in the GitHub repository settings to listen to commits.
3. Install and run Jenkins in a Docker container on your local machine.
4. Use ngrok to expose local Jenkins instance to the internet.
5. Configure Jenkins:
   - Install necessary plugins
   - Set up build steps and GitHub webhook trigger
6. Create a WebEx bot and configure it to receive notifications.
7. Integrate the WebEx bot with Jenkins for build notifications.
8. Test the entire pipeline to ensure it works as expected: Commit code > Code committed on GitHub > Webhook on GitHub sends event to Jenkins through ngrok > Jenkins triggers a build > Jenkins notifies you though a message in your WebEx space.

Submission: Screen Recording

Create and submit a screen recording that demonstrates:

1. Making a code change and committing to GitHub

2. Code is committed to GitHub. Screen recording shows timestamp of code commit in the GitHub GUI (generally shown as ‘now’) (5 points)

3. ngrok showing the incoming webhook in terminal/ console (10 points)

4. Jenkins automatically triggering and running a build (10 points)

5. The build process and results in Jenkins console output shows all python unit tests completing successfully and the build completing without errors (10 points)

6. The WebEx space receiving the build status notification (5 points)

Your recording should clearly show the entire process from code commit to WebEx notification, highlighting the integration of all components.

This assignment aims to integrate and apply the various tools and concepts covered in the course, demonstrating your understanding of CI/CD principles, containerization, webhooks, Python unit tests and automated notifications in a practical scenario.

Resources:

1. This assignment follows up on pointers provided during our sync meeting. The screenshots displayed in class serve as clues to Jenkins configuration.

2. The demo code, Python unit tests and Jenkins Groovy script pipeline are uploaded as indicated during the class and you may choose to use those or create your own.

This is a graded assignment and tests your research and configuration skills.
